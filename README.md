# Find-Missing-Letters
Finds missing letters in a string formed by any types of characters

--HOW IT WORKS
This program takes in input a string, that can be formed by any characters and can be of any length (computationally acceptable length), and it will give as output all the missing alphabetical letters. Special characters and spaces will be ignored.

Time Complexity: O(n)

P.S.: This version contains an array used as letter holder, I will upload in the next times a more space efficient solution.
